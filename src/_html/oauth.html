      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        When you need access to a users' private resources, need to be able to act as another user in chat or
        just want to use Beam credentials to authenticate your users, it's best to use OAuth so the users'
        credentials don't get stored on your servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        OAuth is a system that replaces the credentials by app-specific tokens. Your app can request a set of
        tokens for a certain user with a specific set of permissions. This way your app only gets access to what
        it needs and all other details will stay hidden.
      </p>
      <p>
        To start using OAuth you should start by creating an application as described below.
      </p>

      <h2>Registering your application</h2>
      <p>
        To create an application you can go to the page called <a href="/oauth/manage">Manage OAuth</a>.
        (You might need to authorize the developers site first).
        Once on the page click the <code>Create New</code> button in the top right corner and it'll
        open the creation form.
      </p>
      <p>
        On this page you'll need to enter some basic details about your application, like the name, website and
        logo for your application. All of these will be displayed to the user and are for this reason required.
      </p>
      <h3>Hosts</h3>
      <p>
        The hosts parameter is an important one. This tells us what domains your application can redirect to.
        (We'll explain redirection later)
        This should be domains you control. You can use wildcards, for example: <code>*.beam.pro</code> will
        allow redirects to all subdomains on beam.pro, but not beam.pro itself. The list of domains is comma
        separated if you want to add multiple ones.
