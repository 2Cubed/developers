p Unfollows a channel for the given user.

h3 Parameters

table.endpoint-param-table
    tr
        td.name :id
        td.description The channel ID you wish to follow.
    tr
        td.name user
        td.description The user ID who wants to unfollow the channel.

h3 Possible Results

p You will note that, unlike the follow endpoint, there is no error if the user isn't following the channel. This is because, in the instance, the goal of hitting the endpoint (not to be following the channel) has been accomplished.

+result("Successful", "200 OK").
    "You are no longer following this channel."

+result("Errorful", "403 Forbidden", "This will occur if you don't have permission on the requested user <i>or</i> the user attempts to follow its own channel.").
    "You are not permitted to perform that action."

+result("Errorful", "404 Not Found").
    "Channel not found."
