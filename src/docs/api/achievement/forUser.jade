=endpoint /users/:id/achievements
=description Lists a user's progress on achievements.

include ../../_mixins.jade

p This lists all achievements and the user's progress on those achievements.

p Achievements are a resource in themselves, then the user can gain #[i Achievement Earnings], which record the user's progress and earned status on each achievement. Note that an Earning record will not exist if the user has not made progress on an achievement.

p In this endpoint, the difference is not apparent, but for other endpoints this is something you'll need to keep in mind.
